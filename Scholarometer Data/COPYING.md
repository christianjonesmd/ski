COPYRIGHT NOTICE
============

I am unable to locate copyright information regarding the files 
created using the Scholarometer API[1] (authors.xml, authors-g.xml, 
authors-h.xml, authors-h_m.xml, and authors-h_s.xml); I am not certain 
the results of that search are subject to copyright, but I believe 
that even if so my use of those files is covered under "fair use" as 
that use is for research and scholarship, for nonprofit educational 
purposes, and not for commercial gain, the results are easily and 
freely obtainable to the public from the original source, are 
minimally substantial compared to the wholly available work (as they
include only the "surgery" discipline), should not affect the use of 
the original work as the files here are static while the original is 
dynamically updated, and as they are modified from the original 
without the goal of superseding it.  Great thanks go to the 
Scholarometer team for allowing the use of their work. I hereby release
these files as constructed by me into the public domain with no rights
reserved[2].

The derivative work included in the file Scholarometer.csv is similarly
released into the public domain, with no rights reserved[2].

The file methods.md, this file COPYING.md, and the file combine.sh
are entirely the work of Christian Jones (on-call@christianjones.md), and
are released into the public domain[2] with no rights reserved.
