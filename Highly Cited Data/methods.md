Highly Cited
============

Data obtained from Thompson Reuters Highly Cited Researchers[1]

Excel files as released by Thompson Reuters for "Highly Cited Researchers
2001", "Highly Cited Researchers 2014", and "Highly Cited Researchers
2014, June 2014 Version" (highly_cited_2001.xlsx, highly_cited_2014.xlsx, 
and highly_cited_2014_june_2014.xlsx, respectively) were downloaded from 
the Highly Cited Researchers web site[1] on 29 September 2014.  The entries
from the "clinical medicine" category were selected and apparent duplicate
names were manually edited and their associated notes and affiliations were
combined into a single entry.  The resulting entries were formatted 
manually and using the standardize.sh script into a single file
Highly-Cited.csv.  At this time, none of the data have been further
validated or evaluated.  The 640 entries are in no particular order.
